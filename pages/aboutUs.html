        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>AAHAR SEVA was born out of a shared desire to tackle one of the harshest realities in our country ‚Äî hunger. Many people in India struggle to get even one proper meal a day. As students of VIT University, Chennai, we decided to take a stand.</p>
        <p>We created this platform to bridge the gap between food donors and those who need it most. By empowering NGOs and food suppliers to connect, we hope to make a real difference in people‚Äôs lives.</p>
        <p>From hosting awareness drives on campus to collaborating with local NGOs and restaurants, our journey has been driven by compassion and community. We believe technology can be a powerful tool for social good when fueled by empathy.</p>
        <p>With every meal shared and every life touched, we are reminded why we began. This is more than just a platform‚Äîit‚Äôs a movement to restore dignity and hope through a basic human right: food.</p>
